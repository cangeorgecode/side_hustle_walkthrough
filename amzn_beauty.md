# Amazon Beauty Affiliate Program using AI Influencer Full SOP

## Why bother?
Amazon Affiliate Program pays 10% commission for beauty products
Some beauty products cost $200 → You get $20 per sale
10 sales a day = $200 and 300 sales/month = $60,000 a month
Once set up, minimal work to maintain, so you can do whatever you want
With AI, you don’t need to be a woman to do this

## How to get started?
Sign up for Amazon Affiliate Program and pick a product that sells at a high price and most importantly, has high reviews

### Create an AI influencer
1. Find a reference image that’s already showing your product. Mine is an LED Mask, so I looked up “LED mask” on Pinterest or Instagram
2. To create an AI influencer, pass the following prompt AND the reference image to Nano Banana:
```
   Use the uploaded reference image at MAXIMUM fidelity and 100% reference strength. This is the EXACT woman and the EXACT CurrentBody Skin LED Light Therapy Mask you must copy perfectly.
   Preserve 100% from the reference image:
   - The woman's brown hair (color, length, how it's pulled back)
   - Her head shape, neck, shoulders, body proportions, skin tone on neck and shoulders
   - The full CurrentBody LED mask exactly as shown: white flexible mask, logo, exact shape and fit on her head, straps, black design lines, eye openings, nose and mouth cutouts, and the precise glowing red LED pattern around eyes, nose and mouth

   Do NOT remove the mask. Do NOT change the mask. Do NOT regenerate the mask. Do NOT alter how the mask sits on her face. Keep the mask 100% identical to the reference image.
   Only make these exact changes:
    - Change her clothing to a plush luxurious white terrycloth bathrobe, loosely tied at the waist, soft fabric folds and texture, sleeves slightly rolled.
    - Change the setting to a luxurious modern bathroom with white marble counters and walls, elegant gold fixtures, soft warm ambient lighting, and subtle steam on a large frameless mirror.
    - New pose: Mirror selfie video still. She is holding a black iPhone 16 Pro in her right hand, filming her own reflection in the mirror.

    Significantly boost the red LEDs on the preserved mask to glow brighter, warmer, and more beautiful, with realistic warm red light spill and reflections on her neck, skin, bathrobe, and mirror.

    Ultra-photorealistic mirror selfie still, iPhone 16 Pro quality, cinematic composition, highly detailed textures, accurate lighting and reflections, 8K, extremely realistic, photorealistic, no deformities, no artifacts.
```
3. Save your influencer and use Kling 2.1 or Grok Imagine to create a hyper-realistic clip using the following prompt AND the influencer image:
```
Natural realistic handheld mirror selfie video, 8–10 seconds long. The woman holds a black iPhone 16 Pro in her right hand with subtle natural phone shake and very light handheld movement. She gently films her reflection in the large bathroom mirror. Slow, soft head turns and slight tilts left and right, calm natural breathing visible on her neck and shoulders, minimal body sway. The CurrentBody LED mask stays perfectly fixed on her face exactly as in the image, with the red LEDs glowing bright warm red consistently throughout, creating beautiful moving red light spill and reflections across her neck, plush white bathrobe, and the mirror. Plush white terrycloth bathrobe fabric moves naturally with her breathing and small movements, soft realistic folds and shadows. Luxurious modern bathroom with soft warm ambient lighting and gentle steam in the air. Calm, premium, relaxing atmosphere. Smooth cinematic motion, 30fps, ultra realistic, no sudden jerks, elegant slow movements only, high subject consistency.
```
4. Repeat for different motions, different pose
